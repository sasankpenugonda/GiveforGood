<h1 align="center"> Give for Good </h1>

<p align="center">Give for Good is a cross platform application that offers a user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses to donate excess food to nearby charities and community groups. The app allows user to raise a request in the app letting other users know about the locations where food is needed. The users can provide excess food over there preventing food from being wasted. We also facilitate formation of communities where group of people can join and participate in good deeds for others. Organizations can login using their oragnization name with a valid government proof. They can have fund raising requests for events conducted by them.</p>
